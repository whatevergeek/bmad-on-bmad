# BMAD Method Presentation Outline

## Slide 1: Title & Introduction
**Title:** "BMAD Method: AI-Driven Agile Development That Scales"
**Subtitle:** "From Bug Fixes to Enterprise - One Framework, Infinite Possibilities"

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
- "Imagine having a PM, architect, developer, UX designer, and test engineer all collaborating on your project 24/7"
- "That's BMAD - but they never get tired, never forget context, and work at AI speed"

### The Problem (1 minute)
- AI coding tools are powerful but chaotic
- You get code, but no methodology
- No structure for complex projects
- Single AI assistants hit limits quickly

### BMAD's Position in AI-Driven Development (2 minutes)
**Evolution Timeline:**
- Manual coding → AI-assisted coding → **AI-orchestrated development**

**Comparison with Other Tools:**
- **GitHub Spec Kit**: Static templates → **BMAD**: Living, adaptive workflows
- **Kiro**: Single AI assistant → **BMAD**: 21 specialized agents working together  
- **Google Antigravity**: Code generation → **BMAD**: Complete methodology from analysis to deployment

### Why BMAD? (1 minute)
- **Scale-Adaptive Intelligence**: Bug fix in 5 minutes, enterprise platform with full governance
- **Specialized Expertise**: 21 agents with deep domain knowledge
- **Human-AI Collaboration Orchestration**: Not just tools, but methodology
- **Customizable & Extensible**: Build your own specialized AI teams

## Slide 7: Summary & Visual
**Title:** "BMAD Method - The Future of AI-Driven Development"

### Generated Image Prompt for Nano Banana:
```
Create a modern, professional infographic showing "BMAD Method - AI-Driven Agile Development" with these key elements:

CENTRAL CONCEPT: A circular hub labeled "BMAD Core" with 21 diverse AI agent icons (🧙📊🏗️💻📋🚀🏃🧪📚🎨) arranged around it, connected by flowing lines showing collaboration

FOUR MAIN SECTIONS radiating outward:
1. "Scale-Adaptive Intelligence" - showing progression from bug fixes to enterprise (small → medium → large project icons)
2. "Specialized Agent Teams" - cluster of agent personas working together on documents/code
3. "Custom Module Creation" - BMad Builder creating new agents/workflows with building blocks
4. "Complete Methodology" - workflow arrows showing Analysis → Planning → Architecture → Implementation

VISUAL STYLE: Clean, modern tech aesthetic with blue/purple gradient background, white/light elements, professional iconography

BOTTOM BANNER: "From Bug Fixes to Enterprise - One Framework, Infinite Possibilities"

Include subtle code/workflow elements in background, collaborative arrows between agents, and a sense of organized intelligence working together.
```
