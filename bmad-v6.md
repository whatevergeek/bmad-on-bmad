# BMAD v6 Analysis Report
*Comprehensive Analysis of New Features, Changes, and Recommendations*

---

## Executive Summary

BMAD v6 represents a **complete architectural revolution** from v4, transforming from a collection of expansion packs into a unified, modular framework built on **BMad Core**. This is not an incremental update - it's a ground-up rewrite that fundamentally changes how AI-driven development works.

**Key Transformation:** v4's "expansion pack" model → v6's unified modular architecture with BMad Core foundation

---

## What is BMAD v6?

### Simple Explanation
Think of BMAD v4 as having separate toolboxes for different jobs (one for software, one for games, one for writing). BMAD v6 is like having one master toolbox (BMad Core) that can hold any specialized tools you need, and you can even build your own custom tools that fit perfectly.

### Technical Explanation
BMAD v6 introduces **BMad Core** - a universal framework for human-AI collaboration that enables:
- **Modular Architecture**: Core framework + specialized modules
- **Custom Content Creation**: Build your own agents, workflows, and modules
- **Scale-Adaptive Intelligence**: Automatically adjusts complexity based on project needs
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works across all major IDEs and AI platforms

### 7. Custom Module Installation & Sharing 📦
**What it is:** Create, package, and share custom AI solutions
**Why it matters:** Build once, share everywhere - community-driven expansion

**Installation Flow:**
```bash
# Install core BMAD
npx bmad-method@alpha install
